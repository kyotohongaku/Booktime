# Booktime
Booktime — audiobook player


Main features:

— Adjustable playback speed
— Bookmarks
— Sleep timer
— Shows progress of all your books
— Highlights the last book you listened to
— Equalizer

The app supports the most popular file formats: mp3, m4b, m4a, etc. Asks for very few permissions.

This is not an alternative to Audible. It's just a player (without a selection of books to choose from).
